# Getting started

The first thing you'll want to do is make sure you're running python3, and you have the ability to `pip install` the packages we need. In this case:

`pip3 install requests`

`pip3 install beautifulsoup4`

Depending on how your system is setup, you may need to use `pip` and `python` instead of `pip3` and `python3`

# Running the code

Each step builds on the next. You can run each one by running `python3 scrape_N.py` where N is the each numbered step. The final scraper, scrape_9.py, is fully commented and the final product.
